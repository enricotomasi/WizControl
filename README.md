Unofficial Wiz Light client for Windows

Installing software is simple: download the msi file and run it, follow the instructions and you will find the shortcut to the program on your desktop and in the programs menu.

If you turn on the lamps after running the program just press the button with the "update" symbol and WizControl will perform a new scan of the network.

First time you run program you need to wait finishing of network scannins process. Once finished you will see in the box above the list of Wiz lamps in your network. Select the lamp and with the commands below you can change the brightness, color temperature, and RGB parameters (for bulbs that have this functionality).

You can use WizControl together with the official app or with other apps, the data is updated every 10 seconds, if any parameter is changed by another application, the interface of WizControl updates automatically.

I have tested the app with the following bulbs:

- G.E27 RGB
- G95 Filament
- A60 Filament

If you use it with other models I would appreciate if you let me know if it works fine.
