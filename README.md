# WizControl
Unofficial Wiz Light client for Windows

Installation is simple: download the msi file and run it, follow the instructions and you will find the shortcut to the program on your desktop and in the programs menu.

If you turn on the lamps after running the program just press the button with the "update" symbol and WizControl will perform a new scan of the network.

Using the application is simple: run the program and wait for it to finish scanning the network. Once finished you will see in the box above the list of Wiz lamps in your network. Select the lamp and with the commands below you can change the brightness, color temperature, and RGB parameters (for bulbs that have this functionality).

Please note that with WizControl it is not possible to configure the lamps for the first time, but can only control the lamps already configured with the official app.

You can use WizControl together with the official app or with other apps, the data is updated every 10 seconds, if any parameter is changed by another application, the interface of WizControl updates automatically.

I have tested the app with the following bulbs:

- G.E27 RGB
- G95 Filament
- A60 Filament

If you use it with other models I would appreciate if you let me know if it works fine.
